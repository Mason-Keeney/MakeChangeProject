### Week 1 Homework for Skill Distillery

## Overview

Cash Register Simulator:

This simulator walks the user through entering an item price (Double) and their payment (Double), and then uses two brute force methods to calculate their change, and assign those values to the appropriate bills (up to a $20 bill) and coins.

The simulator will ask "Would you like to continue shopping?" only "Y" (or "y") will continue the program and any other String will exit.

## Lessons Learned

I decided I wanted to try to use arrays for this, and I honestly think that made it way more complicated. Don't be surprised if by the end of this weekend there is a second java file in this project titled something along the lines of "CashRegisterImproved" that doesn't use arrays (or at least uses them better).

There are definitely better methods than the ones I used to accomplish the same things, but sometimes the brute force way is the most fun.
