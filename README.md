## Make Change Project

### Week 1 Homework for Skill Distillery

## Overview

Cash Register Simulator:

This simulator walks the user through entering an item price (Double) and their payment (Double), and then uses the assignVal method to calculate their change and assign those values to the appropriate bills and coins. It will also recognize if there is no change due, or if the user has not paid enough and will adjust appropriately.

The simulator will then ask "Would you like to continue shopping? (Y/N)" only "Y" or "y" will continue the program and any other String will exit.

## Lessons Learned

I decided I wanted to try to use arrays for this, and I honestly think that made it way more complicated. Don't be surprised if by the end of this weekend there is a second java file in this project titled something along the lines of "CashRegisterImproved" that doesn't use arrays (or at least uses them better).

EDIT: Instead of doing a second .java file in the project, I went ahead and wrote out a second version in my own files since I had a working copy uploaded. I was able to reduce the code down from the original 258 lines to 144 and keep all of the functionality in the updated version. After creating the second working program, I overwrote the original submission.

Using Arrays definitely ended up helping reduce the number of lines necessary (for loops + arrays for the win). I look forward to learning better methods for processing data, but this was a really fun project for me. Specifically, figuring out how to get the output I needed from each method and to give it the right input to do what I wanted it to. Hopefully you don't mind that I used something we haven't been introduced to yet in class (Arrays), I'm trying to continue my growth while we're looking at the basics again (I took the Prework very seriously, I convinced myself that if I didn't know it inside and out that I would struggle), and I tried to use the lessons we've been taught over the last week.
